{Chess- A two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, a checkered board 
with 64 squares arranged in an 8×8 grid. Played by millions of people worldwide, 
chess is believed to be derived from the Indian game chaturanga sometime before 
the 7th century. Chaturanga is also the likely ancestor of the East Asian strategy 
games xiangqi (Chinese chess), janggi (Korean chess), and shogi (Japanese chess). 
Chess reached Europe via Persia and Arabia by the 9th century, due to the Umayyad 
conquest of Hispania. The queen and bishop assumed their current movements in the 
Kingdom of Valencia (modern Spain) in the late 15th century, and the modern rules 
were standardized in the 19th century.  Made popular recently by Netflix.}

{Murder Paries- These are party games in which one of the party-goers is secretly playing 
a murderer, and the other attendees must determine who among them is the criminal. 
In some styles of game, the murderer may be aware that they are the killer and in 
other games the murderer discovers this along with the other participants. Murder 
mystery games may involve the actual 'murders' of guests throughout the game, or 
may open with a 'death' and have the rest of the time devoted to investigation.
 Dinner party murder mystery games are generally played with small groups of

for numbers between 20 and 250 attendees, though events can be run with 400+ in
