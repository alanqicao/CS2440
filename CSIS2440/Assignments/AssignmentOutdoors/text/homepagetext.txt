WELCOME TO THE BIG OUTSIDE
Hello, my name is Michael. After many years as the Mountain West Editor and 
primary gear reviewer at Outdoor magazine, I created Outdoors for All with a 
simple mission: to offer stories, images, and expert trip-planning and gear advice 
on America’s and the world’s best hiking, backpacking and other outdoor adventures.
EXPERT TRIP PLANNING
I’ve made a living identifying, planning, and writing about great backpacking 
and hiking trips. Tap into my expertise and save yourself valuable time, hassle,
 and worry.
